# Ark Gateway

ARK uses Kubernetes Gateway API to provide access to services like the APIs and dashboard. The ARK service 'Localhost Gateway' is available to run as a lightweight gateway that allows you to access services.

## Quickstart

Install the Localhost Gateway service with:

```bash
make localhost-gateway-install
```

Each of the ARK services includes an `HTTPRoute` - once the Localhost Gateway has been installed you can see these routes with:

```bash
make routes
```

The ARK Dashboard is configured to run on the base route, from the dashboard you can also see configured services as well as the routes that are exposed:

## Gateway API Overview

The [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) replaces the Ingress API as the next-generation specification for managing HTTP and TCP traffic in Kubernetes clusters. It separates infrastructure configuration (`Gateway`) from application routing rules (`HTTPRoute`), providing better separation of concerns and more powerful traffic management.

The Localhost Gateway service installs the official [Gateway CRDs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api). The implementation of the Gateway used is the popular [NGINX Gateway Fabric 2.0](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/). The [NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/installation/installing-ngf/manifests/) are installed, and then the [NGINX Gateway Fabric 2.0 Helm Chart](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/install/helm/) is installed.

## Architecture

The Localhost Gateway architecture looks like this:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ NGINX Gateway Fabric        │ ◄── Controller that watches and manages Gateway resources
└─────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Gateway                     │ ◄── name: localhost-gateway, namespace: ark-system
│ (e.g. localhost-gateway)    │     listeners: *.127.0.0.1.nip.io:80, 127.0.0.1.nip.io:80
└──────────────▲──────────────┘     gatewayClassName: nginx
               │ parentRef
               │
┌─────────────────────────────┐

│ (e.g. ark-dashboard)        │     parentRefs: [localhost-gateway]
└──────────────┬──────────────┘     backendRefs: [(e.g. ark-dashboard) service]
               │ routes to
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Service                     │ ◄── name: (e.g. ark-dashboard), namespace: ark-system
│ (e.g. ark-dashboard)        │     selector: app=(e.g. ark-dashboard)
└──────────────┬──────────────┘     ports: 3000
               │ routes to
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Pod                         │ ◄── labels: app=(e.g. ark-dashboard)
│ (e.g. ark-dashboard)        │     ports: 3000
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Configuration

### Gateway Resource

The Gateway resource defines the infrastructure configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: localhost-gateway
  namespace: ark-system
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx
  listeners:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    hostname: "*.127.0.0.1.nip.io"
  - name: http-root
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    hostname: "127.0.0.1.nip.io"
```

### HTTPRoute Resources

Services define HTTPRoute resources to expose themselves:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ark-dashboard
  namespace: ark-system
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: localhost-gateway
    namespace: ark-system
  hostnames:
  - "dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io"
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: ark-dashboard
      port: 3000
```

## Service Integration

ARK services automatically create HTTPRoute resources when they include Gateway API configuration. This allows services to be automatically exposed through the gateway without manual configuration.

### Service Requirements

For a service to be exposed through the gateway:

1. **Service resource** - Standard Kubernetes service
2. **HTTPRoute resource** - Defines routing rules
3. **Gateway reference** - Points to the localhost-gateway

### Automatic Discovery

The ARK dashboard automatically discovers and displays services that are exposed through the gateway, providing a centralized view of all available services and their routes.

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

For local development, the localhost gateway provides easy access to services:

1. **Install gateway**: `make localhost-gateway-install`
2. **Deploy services**: Services automatically create routes
3. **Access services**: Use the provided URLs (e.g., `http://dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080`)

### Service URLs

Common service URLs when using localhost gateway:

- **Dashboard**: `http://dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080`
- **ARK API**: `http://ark-api.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080`
- **A2A Gateway**: `http://ark-api-a2a.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Gateway not ready**
```bash
# Check gateway status
kubectl get gateway localhost-gateway -n ark-system

# Check gateway fabric pods
kubectl get pods -n nginx-gateway
```

**Routes not working**
```bash
# List all HTTPRoutes
kubectl get httproutes -A

# Check specific route
kubectl describe httproute ark-dashboard -n ark-system
```

**Service not accessible**
```bash
# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints -n ark-system

# Test service directly
kubectl port-forward service/ark-dashboard 3000:3000 -n ark-system
```
