# Ark Cluster Memory

In-memory storage service with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming support for Ark queries.

- In-memory message storage, or optionally peristed to disk / persistent volume
- Implements the [Memory API](/reference/resources/memory#memory-api-specification)
- Supports [streaming queries](/developer-guide/queries/streaming)

This service provides a basic but complete memory system for an Ark cluster, as well as offering the up-coming streaming APIs which enable real-time streaming responses to queries.

## Installation

Install via `helm`:

```bash
helm install ark-cluster-memory \
    ghcr.io/mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark/charts/ark-cluster-memory
```

Or for local development:

```bash
cd services/ark-cluster-memory

# Deploy the service...
devspace deploy

# ...or run in dev mode with live-reload.
devspace dev
```

## Configuration

All configuration options are documented in the Helm chart. Key configuration is:

Environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| PORT | Server port | 8080 |
| MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE | Maximum message size in bytes | 10485760 (10MB) |
| MEMORY_FILE_PATH | Path to persist memory data | Not set (no persistence) |
| STREAM_FILE_PATH | Path to persist stream data | Not set (no persistence) |

The Helm chart can optionally configure a persistent volume for data storage by setting `persistence.enabled=true`.
