## Quickstart

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed, which is required for installation:

```bash
# Install the 'ark' CLI:
npm install -g @agents-at-scale/ark

# Install Ark:
ark install

# Optionally configure a 'default' model to use for agents:
ark models create default

# Run the dashboard:
ark dashboard
```

In most cases the default installation options will be sufficient. This will install the Ark dependencies, the controller, the APIs and the dashboard. You will need a Kubernetes cluster to install Ark into, you can use [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start), [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/), [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) or similar to run a local cluster. The `install` command will warn if any required dependencies are missing.

User guides, developer guides, operations guides and API reference documentation is all available at:

https://mckinsey.github.io/agents-at-scale-ark/

The 'quickstart' guide will walk you through the process of configuring a model, creating an agent and running basic queries.

## What is Ark?

ARK codifies patterns and practices developed across dozens of client agentic application projects. These projects span multiple sectors, functions, and technology stacks. Through this experience, we identified recurring challenges around platform-agnostic operations for agentic resources and the need for standardized deployment and management approaches.

This project represents the distillation of those learnings into an open-source runtime. While in early access and rapidly evolving based on ongoing team feedback, ARK provides a foundation built on real-world production experience with agentic systems at scale.

## Technical Preview

Agents at Scale - Agentic Runtime for Kubernetes ("Ark") is released as a technical preview and early access release. This software is provided as a Request for Comments (RFC) to share elements of our technical approach with the broader technology community, gather valuable feedback, and seek input from practitioners and researchers in the field of agentic AI systems and Kubernetes orchestration.

As a technical preview release, this software may contain incomplete features, experimental functionality, and is subject to significant changes based on community feedback and continued development. The software is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, and users should expect potential instability, breaking changes, and limited support during this preview phase.

## Credits

The initial design and implementation of Ark was led by [Roman Galeev](https://github.com/Roman-Galeev), [Dave Kerr](https://github.com/dwmkerr), and [Chris Madden](https://github.com/cm94242).
